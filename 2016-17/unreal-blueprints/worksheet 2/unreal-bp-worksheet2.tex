\section*{Introduction}
The goals of this series of workshops is to obtain a good working knowledge of Visual Scripting system in Unreal which is called Blueprints. This will enable you to not only create simple systems in a game (e.g. Triggers) but create full games.

Blueprints is the Visual Scripting language which is shipped inside Unreal Engine 4. This language is node based, where functions and variables can be represented as nodes on the graph and the relationship between these are defined by connections. These connections also allow you to easily see the flow of data through your code. 

\section*{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Understand} The Gameplay architecture of the Unreal Engine 
	\item \textbf{Understand} the syntax of the Blueprints visual scripting system
	\item \textbf{Implement} Unreal Actors using Blueprints
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Worksheet Setup}

This is a continuation of worksheet 1, you should add functionality onto the project from worksheet 1.


\section*{Worksheet Tasks}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item As individuals read the following documentation
%	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
%		\item \textbf{Game Modes, Game States \& Player State} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/Framework/GameMode/index.html}
%		\item \textbf{Actor \& Actor Components} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/}
%		\item \textbf{Pawn \& Character} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/Framework/Pawn/}
%		\item \textbf{Controllers} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/Framework/Controller/} 
%	\end{enumerate}
%	\item Split into Pairs (or Mobs), ideally with someone who is familiar with Unreal. Create a Blueprints FPS Game in Unreal and carry out the following tasks
%		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
%		\item \textbf{Stop} the bullet falling due to gravity
%		\item \textbf{Increase} the initial speed of the bullet
%		\item \textbf{Add} a variable to the projectile blueprint to replace 100 which multiplies the velocity, you should make sure that this variable is editable
%		\item \textbf{Destroy} the bullet regardless of what object is hit
%		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
