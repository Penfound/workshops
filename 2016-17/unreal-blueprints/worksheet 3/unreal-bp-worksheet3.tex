\section*{Introduction}
The goals of this series of workshops is to obtain a good working knowledge of Visual Scripting system in Unreal which is called Blueprints. This will enable you to not only create simple systems in a game (e.g. Triggers) but create full games.

Blueprints is the Visual Scripting language which is shipped inside Unreal Engine 4. This language is node based, where functions and variables can be represented as nodes on the graph and the relationship between these are defined by connections. These connections also allow you to easily see the flow of data through your code.

\section*{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Understand} rhe Gameplay architecture of the Unreal Engine
	\item \textbf{Understand} the syntax of the Blueprints visual scripting system
	\item \textbf{Implement} Unreal Actors using Blueprints
  \item \textbf{Understand} the basics of the collision system in Unreal
  \item \textbf{Understand} how to debug Unreal Blueprints.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Worksheet Setup}

This is a continuation of worksheet 1, you should add functionality into the project from worksheet 1.

\section*{Worksheet Tasks}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item As individuals follow these tutorial videos, you can add the content of these to the existing map or a new one
  	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
      \item \textbf{Introduction to Blueprints} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gY35ezlSQn1sWOGfh4C7ewO/EFXMW_UEDco/index.html}
      \item \textbf{Introduction to Level Blueprints} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gY35ezlSQn1sWOGfh4C7ewO/_zoyaVdqHQ8/index.html}
      \item \textbf{Toggle a light} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gY35ezlSQn1sWOGfh4C7ewO/gHdwOiR0D0A/index.html}
      \item \textbf{Class Blueprints} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gY35ezlSQn1sWOGfh4C7ewO/5YooEu-ktww/index.html}
      \item \textbf{Components and Blueprints} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gY35ezlSQn1sWOGfh4C7ewO/5YooEu-ktww/index.html}
      \item \textbf{Blueprint Functionality} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gY35ezlSQn1sWOGfh4C7ewO/9nMnQE-Zg-o/index.html}
    \end{enumerate}
\item Split into Pairs (or Mobs), ideally with someone who is familiar with Unreal. Carry out the following tasks
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item An Actor which acts like a pickup and \textbf{disapears} when collided with by the player
		\item An Actor which gets \textbf{destoryed} when hit by a bullet
    \item An Actor which acts like a \textbf{launchpad} when the player steps on it
    \item An Actor which \textbf{follows} the player and is destoryed when it collides with the player
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Additional Guidance}
When you are coding it might be difficult to figure out the state of the application, it is often a good idea to set a break point or use Print String function.
