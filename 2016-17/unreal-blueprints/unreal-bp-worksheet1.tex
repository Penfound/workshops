\section*{Introduction}
The goals of this series of workshops is to obtain a good working knowledge of Visual Scripting system in Unreal which is called Blueprints. This will enable you to not only create simple systems in a game (e.g. Triggers) but create full games.

Blueprints is the Visual Scripting language which is shipped inside Unreal Engine 4. This language is node based, where functions and variables can be represented as nodes on the graph and the relationship between these are defined by connections. These connections also allow you to easily see the flow of data through your code. 

\section*{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Understand} the architecture of the Unreal Engine
	\item \textbf{Understand} the syntax of the Blueprints visual scripting system
	\item \textbf{Apply} your knowledge of the Unreal Engine to modify existing systems
	\item \textbf{Implement} changes to existing Blueprints to add functionality
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Worksheet Setup}

In order to complete this workshop we are going to modify the Blueprints FPS Template. This will provide us with some base functionality including 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Basic blocked out environment
	\item First Person Camera Controls
	\item Weapon with projectiles
\end{itemize}

We will then build on this template in the workshops to develop a more fully featured FPS.

\section*{Worksheet Tasks}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Split into groups of 5 and each group member research the following and then report back to  the team with your findings
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item \textbf{Game Modes, Game States \& Player State} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/Framework/GameMode/index.html}
		\item \textbf{Actor \& Actor Components} - \url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/}
		\item \textbf{Pawn \& Character} - url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/Framework/Pawn/}
		\item \textbf{Controllers} - url{https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/Framework/Controller/}
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Split into Pairs (or Mobs) and create a Blueprints FPS Game in Unreal and carry out the following tasks
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
		\item \textbf{Stop the bullet falling due to gravity}
		\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
